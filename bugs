shortcomings

- line
 -- line breaks were ignored in facebook conversations, meaning that any multiline message was cut off.
 -- If a facebook user mentioned any date related string eg 'tuesday' or '2pm today' the message was removed. 
 -- Whatsapp dates were aggresively removed, meaning that in many cases parts of a line and the following line would be deleted along with a space. 
 -- in whatsapp, all colons were used to delimit message fields. meaning that any use of a colon would delete all following text
 -- if any name or 'name like' set of characters appeared within a message, this would result in the creation of a new line. 

- conv
 -- all conversation reference was stripped
 -- conversations were often concatenated 

- users 
 -- When asigning user id's, the first user with that name was assumed to be the corresponding profile. Without taking into account user specific (and very common) contact names. eg jan, sara, mama. This means that many users, are duplicated, split, and artificial. 
 -- Due to the recognition of 'name-like' strings within messages as users, combined with the generic handling of names and ids above, artificial users were created when users mentioned names. 

- annonymisation
 -- all annonimisation was performed using uniform fillers, making it irreversible. Therefore, all subsequent errors cannot be amended. 
 -- addresses were aggresively annonimised, meaning that any word (regardless of POS) would be taken on its characted based level to match a limited list of places in belgium, and then substituted with a uniform location filler. This gave two ramification 1. many abitrary words that matched places in belgium would be removed 2. many more detailed representation of location; ie. actual place names / street names would not be removed. 
 -- as addresses, names were aggressively removed meaning that any caracter matching a name would be subsituted with a uniform filler.
 -- any reference to time, no matter how arbitrary, was idependently and uniformly annonymised.
